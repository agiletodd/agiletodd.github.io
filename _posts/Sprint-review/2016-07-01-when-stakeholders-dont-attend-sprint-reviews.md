[//]: # (Situation)
I have recently worked with a few Scrum Teams that lacked stakeholder attendance in their Sprint Reviews. In short, the purpose of a Sprint Review is for the Scrum Team to meet with stakeholders, inspect the increment, and consider what will be done next. Increment inspection is key to empiricism as it promotes transparency and allows the Scrum Team to effectively inspect and adapt.

When I probed to find out why this might be taking place the answers varied:

+ Stakeholders are too busy
+ We don't need them there because the Product Owner is there
+ They weren't invited
+ They just review our PowerPoint
+ We have nothing to show

[//]: # (Complication)
Stakeholders not attending a Sprint Review regardless of the reason will negatively impact a Scrum Teams ability to be empirical. As a Scrum Team, we want and need constant feedback to ensure we are heading in the right direction and building the right thing. The Sprint Review event in Scrum was designed to do this. In order for Scrum to properly work, stakeholders must attend.

In one instance, stakeholders hadn't attended a Sprint Review for months. When they finally inspected the product they were not pleased whatsoever with the results. In fact, they were so angry that they pulled the plug on the product. That company had wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on a solution that didn't fulfill user needs.

So who is responsible to ensure that stakeholders attend? The Product Owner should be getting the right stakeholders involved in Sprint Reviews at the right time. It is the Scrum Master's responsibility to explain the negative implications on empiricism of them not attending. The Development team must deliver a done increment of software that can be inspected at the end of every Sprint. Everybody is responsible!

Those are very strong statements and the Scrum Team must be working together as a cohesive unit to avoid such threats to empiricism. There is much that goes into delivering and inspecting an increment of software at the end of every Sprint. Ensure that you are striving to do so with passion, cohesively as a team regardless of your Scrum role, and respecting the empirical elements of the Scrum framework. Not doing so could have your company wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars on something nobody will ever use.
