I was recently asked the question:

> For Sprint Reviews, should only the stories that have completed the Definition of Done (e.g. developed, testing and accepted by the Product Owner) be showing during the review?  Or can user stories be shown at the sprint review that have not be deemed complete by the Product Owner?

Not adhering to the Definition of Done is trading a short term gain for a long term loss. By demonstrating incomplete work to stakeholders at a Sprint Review you are inflating what you actually accomplished. This will result in technical debt and may turn your team into a technical debt factory as showing incomplete work becomes habit. It may also disappoint stakeholders later as the pace for which the team is working is perceived to be faster than it actually is.

Butâ€¦ there may be circumstances (albeit rare) that you have no other choice. For instance, if the funding of your project is at stake and it is urgent that you demonstrate substantial progress then show it. However, you should mention what is flawed about the work and not accept it as complete for that Sprint.

Transparency rules the day in these situations. The Product Owner should be aware of the state of a Product Backlog item before the Sprint Review. They know where risks exist with the stakeholders and should keep the Scrum Team abreast of those risks. Ultimately the Scrum Team should discuss the situation and weigh what is the right thing to do given the circumstance.
