[//]: # (Situation)
A Scrum Master is undoubtedly a pivotal role to the successful implementation of Scrum. As a Scrum Master, you serve the Product Owner and Development team by being a teacher, facilitator, coach, and servant leader. Did you know that you are also responsible for serving your organization?

[//]: # (Complication)
I was inspired to write this post after recently meeting with a Scrum Master community of practice (or guild as they call it). The organization for which they work is about two years into the journey of maturing and growing in their use of the Scrum framework. Comprised of mostly project managers turned Scrum Master, they felt as though their roles had been diminished in the 'new world'.

[//]: # (Question)
I asked them a very challenging question: "What are you doing to serve your organization?". I then referenced and began discussing this excerpt from the [Scrum Guide](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html):

[//]: # (Answer)
> ###### The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:
> + Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
> + Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;
> + Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;
> + Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,
> + Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

To me the above excerpt describes a very influential figure in an organization. A person responsible for the overall health of Scrum and supporting practices for an entire organization. A collaborator and true change agent for which an organization will lean when things get tough.

As part of being a Scrum Master it is your duty to retrospectively ask yourself "What am I doing to serve my organization?".
