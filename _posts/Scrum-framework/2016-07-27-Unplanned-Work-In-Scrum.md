[//]: # (Situation)
At some point almost every Scrum team will deal with a fire drill or urgent request that threatens their ability to deliver an Increment of "potentially shippable" product in a Sprint. In most cases this unplanned work is impossible to take into consideration during Sprint Planning. In Scrum, urgent requests can not be ignored simply because they are not in the Sprint Backlog. Ignoring them until the next Sprint is not always a good business answer as they are often unappealing issues negatively impacting the customers.

[//]: # (Complication)
Unplanned work is completely disruptive to a team. When switching context off of an established goal, a Development Team loses focus. Re-establishing focus costs time and is difficult in complex work. The reality is it happens and we must prepare ourselves. Here are four considerations when dealing with unplanned work during a Sprint:

[//]: # (Question)
[//]: # (Answer)

### 1 - Know what's Urgent
Does the request need to happen now? Answering that question is a Product Owner responsibility. The Scrum Master is a servant leader and can work with the Development Team to push back if they don't see the validity of the request. However, the Development Team serves the Product Owner.

A Product Owner makes decisions based on value. If an interruption is the most valuable thing to work on then the Development Team must respect the request. It must be transparent to the Product Owner what the cost of an interruption is. It is the duty of the Development Team to work with the Product Owner to create that transparency. With transparency established, a Product Owner can make a proper decision.

### 2 - Establish a Sprint Goal
A Sprint goal is a higher level objective that a Development Team and Product Owner create in Sprint Planning. The Sprint Backlog contains the what and the how whereas a Sprint goal provides a high level view of what the Increment is forecasted to look like at the end of a Sprint.

Making it a practice to create Sprint Goals leaves room for flexibility in a Sprint. It becomes the Development Teams focus to achieve that goal. That flexibility becomes a continual conversation with the Product Owner and the Development Team as interruptions arise. If an interruption must happen, the conversation should turn to the Sprint goal and whether that goal can remain intact. The Product Owner can use that as push back to non-urgent requests.

### 3 - Focus on Technical Excellence
Is production fire fighting just something that you do and account for in every Sprint? Perhaps it's time to take a step back and unearth the technical debt in your application. Quality and technical excellence should be at the forefront of everyone's mind. The cost of continually fire fighting production issues far exceeds some refactoring time.

No matter what patterns and practices a Development Team has established the focus should be on a high quality, "potentially shippable" product Increment at the end of every Sprint. To establish transparency with the Product Owner on the effort it takes to create an Increment, a Development Team should have a definition of "done". Defining "done" will create a path to technical excellence and a common understanding of what it takes to have a high quality "done" Increment. Once established, there must be a common understanding that not obeying the definition of "done" is trading a short term gain for a long term loss.

### 4 - Use your Retrospective to Adapt
There is not a one size fits all solution to dealing with interruptions during a Sprint. A few ways I have seen Scrum Teams adapt and solve this problem are:

+ Always having a Sprint Backlog item to deal with interruptions
+ Capacity plan (in hours) and allocate a percentage of time for interruptions
+ Simply take them on and deal with them as a collective unit

These were team experiments for which the teams resolved their issues by adapting. In some cases they had to adapt several times before they found the right solution. What works in one context may not work in another. Retrospectives are for Scrum Teams to inspect and adapt. If interruptions are crushing you, then make them a focal point in your Retrospectives until you find a way to deal with them in your given situation.

### Conclusion
Unplanned work can be the silent killer of a Scrum Team. To successfully deal with unplanned work:

+ Ensure there is transparency around the impact of unplanned work.
+ Have a Sprint goal and negotiate scope.
+ Be technically excellent! High quality increments are non-negotiable.
+ Inspect and Adapt frequently to arrive at the best solution for your Scrum Team.

How are your teams dealing with unplanned work?
