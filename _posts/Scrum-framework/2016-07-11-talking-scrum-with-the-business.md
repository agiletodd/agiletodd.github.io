[//]: # (Situation)
This past week I spent two days in New York facilitating one hour Scrum introductory sessions with people from business units (marketing, finance, purchasing, merchandising, real estate, etc.). In the beginning of a session, I'd ask for anybody that had heard of Agile or the Scrum framework to raise their hands. I seldom had a hand raise.

At most, five percent of all the attendees had heard or knew anything about Agile or Scrum. Reflecting on this, I began to wonder how many organizations spend time teaching their business units Scrum and what kind of impact that might have on a Scrum Teams ability to be empirical.

[//]: # (Complication)
I think it's reasonably safe to say that we tend to get micro-focused on the world we work in: mastering engineering practices, sprint goals, daily scrums, code reviews, did the build break, Scrum Master'ing, coaching, etc. It can be hard to think outside of our day to day development activities.

Transparency is important to empiricism and it comes in many forms. Without transparency we can not properly inspect and adapt. So considering this:

### Should we teach a business unit Scrum?
At minimum, I believe it important for us to explain the Scrum framework to them and familiarize them with the terminology. If we don't:

+ The business can be confused by the new terms.
+ A lack of understanding may cause resistance in providing information because it takes too much time away from their job.
+ They may not know who to take a product problem or idea to.
+ They may end up being an impediment for which we have to negotiate greater changes to the organization (i.e. compliancy).

We are to be partnering with the business and transparency is a two-way street. Providing a greater understanding of product development with Scrum will provide some context to them. When people have an understanding they are more inclined to help and not resist. Resistance leads to a lack of transparency whereas helping often opens the transparency door.

### What happens if we don't talk to the business about Scrum?
I certainly believe it will have a negative on empiricism. As we previously discussed, in order to be guided by experience we must be transparent. We can not properly inspect and adapt without transparency. Teaching a business unit what Scrum and empiricism mean will make them less cautious in their interactions. After all, they are often our stakeholders. Remember to break down the walls with business just as much as we break down the walls in technical domains to form cross-functional teams.

### Can a business unit use Scrum?
Business units can absolutely use Scrum to solve their complex problems. They may also implement elements that help them collaborate and communicate. For instance they may choose to meet once a day for fifteen minutes. That being said, unless the Scrum framework is implemented in it's entirety (roles, events and artifacts) do not call it Scrum as Scrum is specifically designed to maximize empiricism.

What was very interesting to me was the amount of discussion we had on culture and Scrum values. It kept recurring over and over with each group I met with. They appreciated what the Scrum values brought to the table and felt they should be an integral part of how they operate. The Scrum values can be practiced regardless of your domain of expertise.

### Conclusion
I had a great time sitting and discussing Scrum with the business units. It always provides a different vantage point and I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to introduce Scrum to many of them. It is important to involve them on our Scrum journey and not forget how much we need their support.
