I am frequently asked about what an individual can do to gain a better understanding of Scrum and display that understanding through certification. Certifications are a good thing and help to demonstrate an individuals expertise in a given domain. They are often what employers look for when gauging a candidates experience and can legitimize a person's breadth of knowledge.

There are a two major accrediting bodies for Scrum certifications: Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance. There are other certifications for Scrum, specifically in the scaling frameworks such as LeSS and SAFe. Likewise, there are alternative Agile certifications like the PMI-ACP. In this post I'm going to inspect the difference between Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance which are the most widely recognized accrediting bodies for Scrum certifications in the world.

### Scrum.org
Scrum.org offers certifications as a Professional Scrum Master (PSM), Professional Product Owner (PSPO), Professional Scrum Developer (PSD), and for Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS). For some of the certifications there are two levels. For example the PSO has both a PSO I and PSO II certification.

In order to acquire a certification you must pay for, take, and pass an exam. No class time is necessary but it will exponentially help your chances in passing one of the tests. These exams are no walk in the park. The level one exams consist of 80 questions for which you need to acquire an 85% or above to pass. The level two exams are essay driven.

By taking one of the classes you will get a credit for taking an applicable exam. The Scrum.org courseware is unified for all of the trainers with a consistent message driven home by all instructors. I believe this increases the probability of a student passing an exam. It also elevates the learning experience of a student as Scrum.org meticulously picks their instructors and is constantly working to improve the training courseware.

### Scrum Alliance
Scrum Alliance offers base certifications for a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM), Certified Product Owner (CSPO), and Certified Scrum Developer (CSD) and more advanced certifications like the Certified Scrum Professional (CSP), Certified Enterprise Coach (CEC), or Certified Team Coach (CTC).

The CSM requires that you attend a CSM class and pass a 40 question exam. The exam is a cake walk so it's really the attendance of the course the Scrum Alliance is striving for. The CSPO only requires that you attend a CSPO course and has no exam. The CSD is at the discretion of the instructor. The more advanced certifications are experience driven and require that you hold other Scrum Alliance certifications before applying.

One important note to make is how the courseware for these courses is established. Scrum Alliance, like Scrum.org, meticulously selects their instructors. Instructors are then required to develop and maintain there own courseware for the classes that they teach. There is a large variability between the curriculum so be careful whom you choose as your instructor.

### Conclusion
As of today, the Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance certifications are equally weighted to prospective employers. Scrum.org's mission is "Improving the Profession of Software Development" whereas the Scrum Alliance is "Transform your world of work today". This is subtly different but impactful to the student experience. Scrum.org is exclusively geared towards the software development world and the curriculum reflects as such. Scrum Alliance may not be (remember the Scrum Alliance curriculum is in the trainers hands).

What's my opinion? I am a bit biased because I am a trainer candidate for Scrum.org. I feel like the exams are legitimate and truly test the knowledge of the person taking the test. 

The CSM and CSPO certifications simply require the attendance of a class. I was fortunate enough to have been through Mike Cohn's CSM and CSPO courses and really gained an excellent comprehension of Scrum because he's a well known and excellent instructor. I will be forever grateful for having attended his classes but right now my vote for the more meaningful certification is for Scrum.org.
