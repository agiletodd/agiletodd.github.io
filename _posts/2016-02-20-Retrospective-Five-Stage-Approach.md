The Sprint Retrospective is the teams opportunity to find ways to be more efficient and to discuss what went right and wrong during the Sprint. This is a very important meeting and is the centerpiece of the empirical nature of an agile environment. Below I discuss a five-stage approach that can help you identify areas of improvement for a team.

There are many techniques a ScrumMaster can use to run a good Sprint Retrospective. Mike Cohn generally recommends the Start, Stop, Continue approach as highlighted in the following blog post, [http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective)

Although I have used the aforementioned approach and had great success I changed my approach after reading Agile Retrospectives Making Good Teams Great by Esther Derby and Diane Larsen. I did not necessarily agree with an overwhelmingly long retrospective (as can be recommended in the book) but it did lead me to believe that I could be getting a little more out of the Sprint Retrospective than I was.

### The Five-Stage Approach

The five-stage approach has helped me better identify areas where the team can improve. I recommend this meeting be time-boxed at one hour. The ScrumMaster often runs a Sprint Retrospective but once you get a level of comfort with this technique, I recommend that teammates rotate the responsibility. It goes without often being said but this Ceremony is exclusively for the team.

### Stage 1: Set the Stage.

The objective of Set the Stage is to get everyone on the team settled into the meeting. There are various techniques to do so but I prefer a quick check-in. Simply go around the room calling on everyone to describe the previous Sprint in one or two word(s).

You should also use this as an opportunity to quickly go over any housekeeping items you may have or want to address. This is a great time to review the Team Etiquette and have the team decide if changes are in order. This part of the meeting should be quick and to the point, there is lots more to do.

### Stage 2: Gather Data.

Now that everyone is settled into the meeting, it's time to extract some data from your teammates. I usually use a two step approach to do this:

+ **Define Events of the Sprint** - Ask teammates what major events happen during the sprint. Some examples of events are: major decisions, milestones, celebrations, big meetings or new technologies implemented.
+ **Review Sprint Data** - Discussing data about the Sprint helps to shed light on what happened. Choose one or two of items to discuss such as: previous retrospective topics, the sprint burn-down, completed or un-complete user stories, defects, technical debt or overall team velocity. Ensure that you call on each teammate as you want to get data from everyone.
Having this information highly visible is a must so whiteboard or post what you unearth in such a way that everyone can see it. What you're trying to gain here is a good comprehension of the Sprint, both good and bad.

### Stage 3: Generate insights.

You now have a good understanding of the Sprint from the Data, so you want the team to brainstorm areas where the they can improve. Improvement might take the form of starting, stopping or continuing to do something (inline with Mike Cohn's Start/Stop/Continue approach). You want everyone involved so call on teammates that are less inclined to offer an opinion. Again this information should be highly visible to the team so whiteboard or post it.

### Stage 4: Decide what to work on.

Based off of the Insights that you generated, now it's time for the team to decide what to work on improving in the next Sprint. Lead a conversation around what two or three of the most crucial topics are. Have the team discuss ways they can improve those topics and set goals for doing so.

A few examples of results may be: get better at estimating, organize the work so no teammates are bottlenecks, keep doing a good job of updating the Scrum board or stop allowing interruptions from the Product Owner.

The end result should be two or three goals of improvement the team agrees to work towards in the next Sprint. I like to post these in a very visible place so the team is constantly reminded of them as the days progress.

### Stage 5: Close the meeting.

At last we've reached the end and have found ways for the team to get better. This is a great opportunity to thank your teammates for a job well done in the Retrospective and during the Sprint. If you rotate who runs this Ceremony it is a good idea to remind the next individual responsible.

### Conclusion.
There are many techniques you may use to implement the five-stage approach. This is what has worked for me in the past but I certainly will continue to experiment.
