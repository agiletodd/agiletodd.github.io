The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals.

This technique is a time-boxed way of working. The general concept is to work in short time-boxes of a given duration (25 minutes for example). A timer should be set at the start and when time expires a new interval can begin or a short break may be taken. As distractions arise they should be noted and dealt with when time expires. It is recommended that each time-box be tracked which can be done simply by placing a tick mark on a piece of paper at the conclusion of the time-box.

The stages of a time-box are planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing. This technique has proven to be effective in the world of software development. Read more and give it a try:
