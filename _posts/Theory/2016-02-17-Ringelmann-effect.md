The Ringelmann effect is the tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases. The size of a Development team in a Scrum implementation is to be 3 to 9 people. This is in accordance with the findings and studies that have been done to prove out the Ringelmann effect.
