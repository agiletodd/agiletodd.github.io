Tuckman's model for group development is an often referred to model when starting and growing new Scrum teams.

The model states the following are inevitable stages for a team to grow and self-organize around complex problems:

### Forming
The "getting to know you stage", forming is when a team meets and understands the problem at hand. In this stage individualism still exists as members of the team are cautious and are "feeling each other out".

### Storming
Opinions have been formed amongst the teammates and often conflict veers it's head. "Storming" implies that there may be lightning and thunder between teammates. This is a stage to be cognizant of as a Scrum Master, coach or leader as you want find creative ways to resolve conflict often putting it back on the team to do so (which I have found to be most effective). Be weary of this stage, I have worked with teams that get stuck here.

### Norming
Conflicts have been resolved and the team begins rallying behind a common goal. Often emotions still are high from the storming phase so individuals may feel the need to avoid conflict. Be conscience of hidden conflict and channel Retrospectives to draw out negative behavior that might be getting "swept under the carpet".

### Performing
The team has reached the mecca of high performance and self-organization. They are able to operate as a cohesive unit and are driven to be successful as a unit.

### Conclusion
It is not uncommon for teams to jump between stages. A good team will recognize this and self correct to rally to the performing stage. Scrum Masters can lend a hand by recognizing where teams presently exist in this model and facilitate to get them to the next level. Note, this is a Scrum Team responsibility the Scrum Master can only facilitate.
