INVEST is a mnemonic developed by Bill Wake that Scrum Teams can use, when writing or refining user stories, as a mechanism
to determine if a user story is "ready".

+ **Independent**: A good story should stand on its own.
+ **Negotiable**: A good story is negotiable. It is not an explicit contract for features; rather, details are co-created by the customer and programmer during development. A good story captures the essence, not the details.
+ **Valuable**: A user story should be valuable to the business.
+ **Estimable**: The team should be able to gauge the size of a story.
+ **Small**: A good rule of thumb is that a user story should not be more than eight to sixteen hours of effort.
+ **Testable**: The story should include validation criteria.
