The 3C's is a formula Ron Jeffries created to capture the components of a user story.

+ **Card**: Often on a post-it note or index card, this represents the written text of a user story. It is a written invitation to have a conversation. A card cannot contain an exhaustive list of requirements which enforces the principle of emergent requirements and the inception of a conversation surrounding the requirement.
+ **Conversation**: A user story is not a contract, it is the opportunity to engage in a conversation about the requirement. The outcome of those conversations is a shared understanding of it and a refined view of what is needed to full-fill it. In Scrum, these conversations are generally instantiated by a Product Owner.
+ **Confirmation**: To be considered done a team must ensure that a user story meets it's "Definition of Done" but also full-fills the requirement. Acceptance criteria (or conditions of satisfaction) are details which are user story specific and further elaborate on constraints the story may have. Confirmation should be the formal acceptance that ensures it meets the quality standards of the team but also is accepted as "done" by parties outside of the Scrum Team.
