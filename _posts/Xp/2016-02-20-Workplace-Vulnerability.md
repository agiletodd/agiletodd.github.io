One of the first books I read on Agile Software Development was Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck, a book I credit for starting my agile journey. A topic in the book that I remember vividly and found undeniably important was the concept of Workplace Vulnerability.

In definition, Workplace Vulnerability is the need for others to control and manipulate us and of our need to control and manipulate others. Two general examples are:

+ Holding something back in order to be safe (estimating work effort for example).
+ Not being open about what we're capable of doing (being uncomfortable with a new technology stack).

In an Agile Software Development environment (or any workplace for that matter) this concept can be crippling if left unattended. It is our job as leaders to be cognizant of it and take steps towards preventing it. By being honest, open and not holding back information we can create an atmosphere of safety that will prevent Workplace Vulnerability from veering it's ugly head.

The key objective is to always do the best job you can. If you fail learn from it and move on. Put all your cards on the table and go all in for the win. Steve Jobs once said, "The greatest artists like Dylan, Picasso and Newton risked failure. And if we want to be great, we've got to risk it too."

Have you witnessed Workplace Vulnerability? What have you done to eliminate it? Tell us about it.
