A team etiquette may also be called a team working agreement. The purpose of developing a team etiquette is so a team has a set of rules to follow that will enable them to work effectively together. The etiquette should be defined by the team and contain high level ‘rules’ that all team members agree to follow. In a Scrum environment, the Scrum Team owns this item and can use it as a tool to keep the team running smoothly.

### How to define a team etiquette
The Scrum Master will schedule a time when all teammates are available (preferably when the entire team is co-located). The team will then brainstorm items that have been pain points in the past or could potentially negatively impact a team working effectively together. The etiquette should not be an exhaustive list of every possible pain point the team could encounter. It should contain a list of ten or so items that the team finds very critical to its success and health.

As with anything else in an agile environment, if it’s not working then change it. The best opportunity to change (add/edit/remove) etiquette items is during the Sprint Retrospective. The Scrum Team should open the retrospective by asking if any modifications to the etiquette are necessary.

### What happens if someone breaks a ‘rule’?
There are various methods as a Scrum team you can take to help the team conform to the newly minted team etiquette. You can simply watch and communicate it to the teammate, put checkmarks on a board ticking a teammate’s offenses or make a teammate do something silly.

A method some of the teams I've worked in the past have used is to develop a ‘fine’ that a team member 'owes'' when breaking a rule. Each team etiquette rule would carry a cost amount depending on the impact of the rule. You can use money or a tangible item such as k-cups as the fine. Remember to keep it reasonable ($1 or less for the most severe fine) and it is perfectly acceptable to create an IOU on a whiteboard (not everyone has cash or the selected item on hand). It is the teams to ‘own’ so whatever accumulates belongs to the team.

### Examples of items you may find on a team etiquette
+ Someone breaks the build.  
+ Being late to the daily scrum.
+ Cellphone use during team activities.
