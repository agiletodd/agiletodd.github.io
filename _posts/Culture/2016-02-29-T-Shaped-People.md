The only title that exists on a development team is "Developer". Hang in there don't quit reading let me explain. Everyone is developing something not just code. It could be a UX person developing wireframes, a QA analyst creating test scripts or a DBA creating data models. How can a person with a strong skillset in a specific area become a better cross-functional teammate? By concentrating on becoming T-Shaped.

Individuals and teams should work to overlap their skills; that is not to say that everyone on the team has a generic skillset. A T-shaped individual can be described as someone who has a depth of experience in one domain (the vertical line) but also has a breadth of knowledge in a few other domains (the horizontal line).

Why should you or a teammate care about being T-shaped? If you exclusively focus on one area of expertise you are inadvertently making yourself fragile in the world of software development. An anti-fragile skillset allows an individual to pivot to a breadth domain when a teammate needs help, in times of crisis, as your interest fades in an area of depth or as new technology emerges. So the next time a teammate with a differing depth than you is diving in, ask to go along for the ride!

 An example of a cross-functional, T-Shaped team:

- **Developer #1**
    - Depth: Web Development
    - Breadth: Scrum
    - Breadth: Web Services
- **Developer #2**
    - Depth: Data
    - Breadth: Web Services
    - Breadth: Web Development
- **Developer #3**
    - Depth: Web Services
    - Breadth: Web Development
    - Breadth: Test Automation
- **Developer #4**
    - Depth: Quality Assurance
    - Breadth: Test Automation
    - Breadth: Web Development
