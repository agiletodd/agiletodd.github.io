Looking for training on Scrum but unsure which course is the right course for you? Is your organization struggling adopting Agile? Maybe you just want to take a course that will help you build really good software.

There are an ever growing number of Scrum courses surfacing in the software development industry. There is no doubt that Agile and Scrum are very hot right now. To maximize your potential it is important to select training that is in alignment with your goals. Most importantly you have to make sure the trainer and the curriculum they teach will not waste your money.

### About the Professional Scrum Foundations course
The Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF) course is for everybody. Don't be deterred thinking it's a simple class because it is challenging for experts in every domain (coders, testers, managers, operations, designers, etc.). It was designed by Scrum.org with Ken Schwaber at the helm and a trainer community that is filled with experts in the software development industry.

The course is two days and is packed with action. It thoroughly covers the Scrum framework, how to master Scrum, planning in Scrum and what you need to do to keep Scrum healthy. The class self-organizes into teams that work together in Sprints. Students get to experience Scrum first hand and will take home lessons learned from actually working in Scrum during the class.

I took the PSF course in London as part of the Scrum.org train the trainer program and walked away impressed. Being a seasoned veteran in Scrum I couldn't believe the number of takeaways I had. I also found it fun and engaging to work with teammates in a series of Sprints during a class.

For all you coders out there, I was elated at the fact I got to pound some keys during the class. Non-coders don't be scared you don't have to code to be a developer. Everyone is a developer in Scrum because we all develop something (requirements, test cases, design, etc.).

### Do I get a Certification
After attending the PSF course each student will receive a credit to take the Scrum.org [Professional ScrumMaster level I (PSM I)](https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments/PSM-I-Assessment) exam. The PSM I certification is the premier certification recognized in the software industry that will display a solid understanding of Scrum on your resume. You can read more about the differences in certification on my blog post on [Debunking Scrum Certifications](/training-certification/2016/03/30/Scrum-Certifications).

At present the exam credit doesn't expire but I recommend that students take the exam soon after the course. I will post a study guide at a later date (it's on my Product Backlog).
