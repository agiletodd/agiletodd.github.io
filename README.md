I'm looking for solid contributors for this blog to help put some great content out to the Scrum community. The blog is not about the specifics of the Scrum Framework (Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber have that covered in the Scrum Guide) and many other books and blogs have been written. This is about supporting methodologies, practices or thoughts that can support and enhance a Scrum implementation. Contact me if you're interested in contributing.

Want to contribute but don't know how to start? I'm presently using Atom to write the posts using Markdown syntax (which is super easy). I've got Jekyll locally running on both windows and macosx which was a breeze to get setup.

For windows this was the easiest path to get jekyll up and running via chocolatey: https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/.
