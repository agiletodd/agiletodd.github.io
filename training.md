### Private Courses
I welcome the opportunity to come into your organization and train you in a private course. Private courses are for students all residing from the same organization. These courses are generally taught on premise but other accommodations can be made.

This is a cost effective way to get professional Scrum training in your organization in a private setting. Email me at <a href="mailto:todd@xperientsoftware.com" target="_top">todd@xperientsoftware.com</a> for my availability.

### Professional Scrum Foundations
The Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF) course is a 2-day course that teaches Scrum in a highly practical way. Working in a series of Sprints, teams of students build a software application, thereby facing real-life problems. The mechanics, roles, principles and (empirical) process of Scrum are demonstrated. Common missteps and misunderstandings are discussed so students grow a higher awareness of their symptoms.

Attending this course will give you a credit to taking the Professional Scrum Master I exam. Upon passing the exam you will receive a PSM I certification.

### Professional Scrum Developer
The Professional Scrum Developer (PSD) course is a 3-day course that teaches how to create great software using the Scrum framework. Working in a series of Sprints, teams of students collaborate, apply modern engineering practices, and use the Scrum framework to cope with changes. They learn how to develop increments of potentially releasable functionality from a realistic Product Backlog.

Attending this course will give you a credit to taking the Professional Scrum Developer I exam. Upon passing the exam you will receive a PSD certification.
