### Private Courses
We welcome the opportunity to come into your organization and train you in a private course. Private courses are for students all residing from the same organization. These courses are generally taught on premise but other accommodations can be made.

This is a cost effective way to get professional Scrum training in your organization in a private setting. Email me at <a href="mailto:todd@xperientsoftware.com" target="_top">todd@xperientsoftware.com</a> for availability.

Common missteps and misunderstandings are discussed so students grow a higher awareness of their symptoms.
